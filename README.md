WhenToPlayVideo is a user-friendly web application, built using React/Next.js, designed to simplify the process of syncing YouTube videos to specific timestamps set by the user, making it perfect for special occasions or celebrations.

- Quickly sync YouTube videos to specific timestamps for special occasions or celebrations, even those that are longer than 24 hours.

- Use standard or shortened YouTube URLs, with the option to specify the timestamp parameter within the link; WhenToPlayVideo will automatically initiate playback from the specified time.

- WhenToPlayVideo supports YouTube video playback by parsing parameters directly to its URL, enabling users to effortlessly customize playback with Video ID and timestamp specifications directly from the URL.

  - For standard links, use `https://whentoplayvideo.vercel.app/watch?v=VIDEO_ID&t=TIMESTAMP`
  - For a more concise version, use `https://whentoplayvideo.vercel.app/VIDEO_ID?t=TIMESTAMP`. WhenToPlayVideo automatically validates whether the provided value is a valid YouTube Video ID or not.

- User-friendly design powered by Tailwind CSS for a responsive experience across different resolutions, compatible with mobile devices.
